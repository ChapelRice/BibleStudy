These are my notes debating the claim that the Killing of the Innocents (KOI) event documented in Matthew 2:16-18 did not occur. The event's historical accuracy is disputed because it is not recoreded in the history books, and it is not in any other gospel. These two issues are discussed below.
<br>

**Why is KOI not in the History Books?** - Here are a few options:
1. It did not happen
2. It was not recorded on purpose - Possible but unlikely
   -  Nicolaus of Damascus and Josephus are the two historians we look to here, and they both leave out the KOI event.
   -  Nicolaus was Herod's friend, and Josephus used Nicolaus as a source. I have not read either in their entirety, but it appears that Nicolaus was generally favorable to Herod, his friend.
   -  Josephus is expected to have used Nicolaus as a source, but he is less favorable to Herod and includes more of the negative aspects which would have been common knowledge at the time or documented in other sources, such as:
      - Executing his wife
      - Executing two of his sons and his brother-in-law
      - Cruelty, Paranoia, and Despotism
      - Execution of prominent Jews, the burning alive of Matthias
    - This all leads us to the question "Why would Josephus include all these but not the KOI (if it was a signiciant event)?" Seemingly unlikely.
3. It was removed from the history books - Unlikely
    - There is no real reason this would be the case as far as I know, and Josephus records Jesus as a well known, wise teacher who was crucified under Pontius Pilot. He also refers to John the Baptist.
    - Anyone removing the KOI event would likely be trying to erase references to Jesus in the historical record, so why would they take it out and leave the record of Jesus' crucifixion?
       - Similarly, some believe Josephus reference to Jesus Cricifixion was fabricated and added later by christians. The exclusion of the KOI event hurts this case. If the Crucifixion was inserted later, the fabricators should have inserted the KOI event too...
4. It was not well known - Unlikely
   - This seems possible but less likely, Bethelem was a small town, so it may not have been big news for something bad to happen there. Clearly people traveled around from Jerusalem to Galilee regularly, Mary and Joseph were, so news would not be that isolated.
5. It was not worth recording - This is the most likely
   - Jerusalem was not a large place. The population has been estimated from 300-3000 people. There may have been only 10 babies killed.
   - In the ancient world, the killing of babies was not that uncommon. The Greeks would leave babies out to die of exposure if they did not want them, and the Romans had similar practices.
   - With the small population, 10 babies in a small town being killed by a well known "mad king" might not make the news, or the history books.
+ The notable history books that the KOI are not recorded in are by Nicholas of Damascus and Josephus. Nicholas of Damascus was Herod's friend and wrote about him. Josephus was likely using Nicholas of Damascus as a source when he was writing in 94 AD, almost 100 years after the event. Eusebius records the KOI event, but Eusebius was writing in the 4th century, and Matthew was his source for the event.

**Why is Matthew the only gospel to record the KOI?**
1. It did not happen - If this is the case, there are two options:
    1. Matthew or his source made it up - Why?
        - You can read scholars that will say the Magi, KOI, and Flight to Egypt were added in to draw parallels to Moses. They would say "It is a Jewish literature thing..."
        - You could also say that it was added to show fulfilment of prophesies... This brings up the question of why did they add it to only one major account?
    2. It was added later - Why?
        - Again, the reason it might have been added later was to show fulfilment of prophesies, and again it brings up the question as to why they would not have been added to other accounts?
2. These events were not relevant/less relevant to the other Gospel writer's purposes
    - Quick note: Mark written 60-75, Matthew 70-85, Luke 80-110, and John 90-100. Mark was the basis for Matthew and Luke, "Synoptic".
    - Mark and John skip over Jesus birth and such. In this case, we can ignore their exclusion of a specific event around Jesus' birth.
        + Mark jumps straight to John the Baptist teaching, and his big thing is "Immediatly".
        + John starts with "In  the beginning" then quickly jumps to John the Baptist teaching.
    - Luke talks about Jesus' birth. Here is a small synopsis of Luke's account and the differences:
        + We hear a lot more about John the Baptist's conseption and birth here.
        + We see more of Mary's version of the story vs Joesph's in Matthew. We hear "Mary kept these things in her heart and thought about them often."
        + Both accounts speak of going to Bethlehem, Luke mentions the Census as the reason.
        + Luke talks about the Shepherds coming on the day of his birth and the "heavenly host."
        + We then hear the account of the purification offering, where Simeon and Anna are seen. These are not in Matthew.
        + Luke then has them going straight back to Nazareth in Galilee as soon as they could...
        + This account talks about Jesus going back to Jerusalem every year and we have the scene of Jesus talking with the teachers at the temple.
        + Next thing we see is John the Baptist teaching.
    - Here is the rundown of Matthew's account of this time:
        + Joseph is visited by an angel telling him not to divorce Mary.
        + The three wise men come next, and their seeing Herod is the prompt for the KOI.
        + Joseph again is visited by an angel and told to flee to Egypt, and the Killing of the Innocents happens at this time.
        + When Herod is dead, Joesph is again visited in a dream and told to go home.
        + Joseph gets scared as he approaches Judea because Herod's son is the new ruler, and he is told by an angel again to go to Galilee.
        + Next thing we see is John the Baptist teaching.
    - Notice that the perspecive in Matthew is primarily from Joseph, and in Luke it is primarily from Mary. While that is an important note and could be reason for differences in the story, what gets emphasized, etc. The KOI and resulting flight to Egypt should be significant to both of them...
    - Whether the KOI happened or not, Matthew is drawing a connection from Moses to Jesus. His audience is the Jews, and one of his major themes is that Jesus is the rightful heir to David, the Jewish Messiah, the fulfillment of the law given to Moses etc.
    - Luke is the Doctor/Scientist/Historian of the four Gospel writers, and his audience is wider. He also comes later. His emphasis on fact, and the lack of documentation of the KOI event may have led him to leave the event out, as it's validity was in question to him as well as us, and it did not necessarily help the narrative and the themes of his writing.
